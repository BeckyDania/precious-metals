MVC User Story - Backend Inventory Manager
- User can review bullion inventory 
- User can create new inventory
- User can edit the inventory
- User can delete inventory 

While this seems very straight forward for a CRUD App - each component will require individual wireframes to identify features for optimal functionality and user-friendliness - in order to meet the following stretch goals:

Stretch goals
- Login page - for Admin - using BCrypt
- Display the spot price for bullion on NAV bar from external API
- use external API to update pricing
- Create frontend - customer facing store
